<h1>Activation Lock Bypass for A11 - A9 Devices</h1>
<p style="color: #f00;"><strong>Disclaimer: </strong>I cannot be held liable for any damages, charges, or other
    consequences resulting from the use of this guide.</p>
<p>This guide is intended for research purposes only. Please use it solely on devices that you <strong>legally
        own</strong> and have obtained through legal means.</p>
<p>Follow these instructions closely, any fuck-ups might make you have to redo the entire process.</p>
<p>Note that <strong>several services will not work.</strong> Cellular, iCloud sign-in (you can still sign into App
    Store to get apps), passcode, ANYTHING Secure Enclave related, booting untethered, <strong>among other
        things.</strong></p>
<p>You will need:</p>
<p><strong>- A computer, preferably on macOS. Linux should work too.</strong></p>
<p><strong>- A reliable/OEM Lightning cable.</strong></p>
<p><strong>- The locked iDevice in question</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Some sanity, just in case</strong></p>
<p>Without further ado, let's get started!</p>
<p><strong>1. </strong>You probably noticed that I didn't specify an iOS version. This doesn't matter, you're gonna need
    to restore your device anyways.</p>
<p>Freshly restore your device (use iTunes, Finder, or look up how to), power it on, but DO NOT connect to Wi-Fi or try
    to complete setup, as going to the
    "iPhone Locked To Owner" screen fucks with some values that we'll need.</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong>Clone this git repo, cd into it using this command:</p>
<p><code>git clone https://github.com/randomuser691337/palera1n-mod-fixed/ && cd ./palera1n-mod-fixed/</code></p>
<p><strong>LINUX USERS ONLY: </strong>You may need to run the following commands (before running the software) in a new
    terminal (KEEP IT OPEN!):</p>
<p><code>sudo systemctl stop usbmuxd && sudo usbmuxd -p -f</code></p>
<p><strong>3. </strong>Now let's actually get started. We'll need to jailbreak with palera1n first to prepare the files
    (run these commands in the folder we CD'ed to earlier):</p>
<p><code>./palera1n.sh --tweaks [iOS version here, replace this with what's on your device e.g. 15.8]</code>
</p>
<p>Let the script run and follow any screen prompt if any. When it finishes you should be booted into iOS again. If for
    some reason you end up in recovery mode, try running the command again and it should boot you into iOS.</p>
<p>If everything was succesful and you booted into iOS, we are going to start the bypass process. Type the following
    command in the terminal:</p>
<p><code>./palera1n.sh --bypass [iOS version, same as before]</code></p>
<p>Let the process finish and your device should be in recovery mode.</p>
<p>Once in recovery mode, we are already done with the bypass, just run this command to boot:</p>
<p><code>./palera1n.sh --tweaks [iOS version, same as before]</code></p>
<p>DO NOT SET A PASSCODE OR SET UP TOUCH ID! This may end in constant crashes, and a setup crash loop, which would make you need to redo this whole process.</p>
<p>Proceed as normal, skip Wi-Fi setup, and you should be able to jailbreak with palera1n using the Tips app if wanted.</p>
<h1>You're done! Now what?</h1>
<p><strong>Setting a Passcode Test (A9 devices only)</strong></p>
<p>1. Complete the initial setup without setting a passcode.</p>
<p>2. Navigate to Settings &rarr; Touch ID and Passcode, then set a passcode.</p>
<p>If your device crashes or blackscreens and reboots to recovery, you won't be able to set a passcode. To recover, simply boot using the same command as before: <code>palra1n.sh --tweaks</code>.</p>
<p>If it sets normally/completes without crashing, congrats! You can set a passcode and Touch ID!</p>
<p>In case that the JB breaks and you need to restore it, do the following:</p>
<p><code>./palera1n.sh --restorerootfs [iOS version]</code></p>
<p><code>./palera1n.sh clean</code></p>
<p><code>./palera1n.sh --tweaks [iOS version]</code></p>
<p><code>./palera1n.sh --bypass [iOS version]</code></p>
<p><code>./palera1n.sh --tweaks [iOS version]</code></p>
<p>And you should be booted back in with a clean JB, once again!</p>
